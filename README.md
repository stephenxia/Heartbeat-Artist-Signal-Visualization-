MSP430 code used for signal drawing/visualization system.  It is divided into two parts.  One part is the code that controls the servo motor and pen used to draw the signal.  The other controls the stepper motor or time-axis.
The servo_pen folder contains the code used to operate the servos.  The stepper_roll contains the code used to operate the stepper motor to roll and move the paper that is drawn on.
